Embed Google Fonts tries to automatically replace registered Google Fonts from themes and plugin with local versions, directly loaded from your own server.

== Description ==

Embed Google Fonts tries to automatically replace registered Google Fonts from themes and plugins with local versions, directly loaded from your own server.

**Contribute**: [https://github.com/moewe-io/embed-google-fonts](https://github.com/moewe-io/embed-google-fonts)

**Notes**

* The first request might be very slow, as fonts are downloaded and cached the first time they are requested.
* This doesn't automatically replace all your Google fonts with local versions. If a plugin/theme doesn't use WordPress wp_enqueue_style it probably won't work.
* Loaded fonts are not optimized, means, the whole font including all subsets is loaded
* See FAQ for instructions to use locally hosted fonts directly and avoid using Heroku

**Thank you:** Fonts are downloaded using: [https://gwfh.mranftl.com/fonts](https://gwfh.mranftl.com/fonts)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to use locally stored fonts directly? =

It is possible to avoid using Heroku and directly use locally hosted fonts.

Easy way:

* Let the plugin download the fonts
  * Click the button in the plugin list overview ;)

Custom way:

* Create a folder "embed-google-fonts" in your "wp-content" folder
* For every font create a subfolder, i.e. "embed-google-fonts/open-sans/"
  * Create a file "embed-google-fonts/open-sans/_font.css"
  * Edit your "_font.css" to include rules for loading your local font

= Does this work with every theme and plugin? =

No, themes and plugins must use wp_enqueue_style to load Google Fonts.
Just try it, if it works, than you are fine.

= Does it work with caching plugins? =

Generally yes. You may exclude some files, if there are problems.

= Does it work with WP Rocket? =

Yes, it is working with WP Rocket.

= Does it work with WP Fastest Cache? =

If you are using [WP Fastest Cache](https://de.wordpress.org/plugins/wp-fastest-cache/), you should create an exclude CSS rule for "_font.css"

= Does it work with Divi? =

You have to disable

* **Improve Google Fonts Loading** and
* **Defer jQuery And jQuery Migrate**

in

* **Divi → Theme Options → General → Performance**

== Upgrade Notice ==

Nothing special

== Screenshots ==

There is no UI or something like this. So no screenshots needed.
